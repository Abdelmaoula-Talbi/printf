NAME
	_printf

SYNOPSIS

	#include "main.h"

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION

	The function _printf produces output according to a format as described below.

	The format string specifies how subsequent arguments (or
       	arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of
       	stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

	The format string is a character string composed of zero or more directives:
	ordinary characters (not %), which
       	are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
       	specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
       	subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
       	introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion
       	specifier.

	Conversion specifiers
       	A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
       	The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

d, i   	The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

c	the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is
	written.

s	the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type
        (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are
        written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

RETURN VALUE
	
	Upon successful return, _printf returns the number of
       	characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to
       	strings).
	If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

EXAMPLES

	To print a string:

	#include "main.h"
	_printf("%s", "string to print");
	or
	_printf("%s", <name of the variable of type char *>);

	To print a simple character:
	
	#include "main.h"
	_printf("%c", 'character to print');
	or
	_printf("%c", <name of the variable of type char>);

	To print a string with ordinary characters (not %):
	
	#include "main.h"
	_printf("string with ordinary characters to print");
	
	To print an integer:
	
	#include "main.h"
	_printf("%d(or i)", integer or <name of the variable of type integer>);
